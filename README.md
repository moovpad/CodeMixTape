# REPOSITORY README
Hopefully this intro readme file will be helpful along our Xamarin journey. Here we go...

# Wiki
Som useful info about the MOOVPAD project has been added to the Wiki section (see link above), as well as descriptions of issues experienced during development.

# CustomControls Folder
This folder contains a set of files creating and describing a cusom textbox control. The four files include the three WinForm files for the user control (.cs, .designer.cs, and .resx) as well as a CustomTXT.txt file that describes the steps used to create the custom textbox. This method was learned through a short tutorial and I thought it might be useful to share here. Similar methods will be used to create other custom controls for the MOOVPAD UI on different platforms.

# GitHub-Demo-01.xaml
This file is a simple demo of the ScrollView and Grid implementations. Nothing fancy, just the basics (although the default ScrollViewBarVisibility property is changed from the default in this case.


Stay awesome.
