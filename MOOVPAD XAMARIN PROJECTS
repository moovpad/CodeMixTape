# PROJECT OVERVIEW
The Xamarin projects being developed for mobile deployment form part of a suite of health and fitness apps. These apps will make use of research completed in clinical and exercise physiology, which has led to several patent applications and a new framework of algorithms for assessing performance during exercise and training. I won't go into too much detail here, but suffice it to say that I found a gap in the established science relating to physiologic efficiency. The MOOVPAD project goals are focused on building the tools necessary to help professionals and those training for their own health and fitness to better understand their performance (as opposed to using measures like heart rate in isolation).

# PARTS OF THE PROJECT
Broadly speaking, the dev work initially aims to deliver a suite of apps for desktop and mobile devices running:
1. Windows PC
2. macOS
3. Android
4. iOS
5. UWP
